# Strategy Lifecycle — Promotion State Machine

**Last updated**: 2026-05-06  
**Owner**: Monitor / DB layers  
**Status**: Foundations shipped; paper-trading executor deferred (see [deferred spec](../../tasks/strategy_lifecycle_remaining.md))

## Why Two State Machines?

Atlas has **two orthogonal lifecycle concepts** for strategies. Conflating them causes bugs.

| Dimension | Module | States | Question answered |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Promotion lifecycle** | `monitor/strategy_lifecycle.py` | `RESEARCH → PAPER → LIVE → RETIRED` | *Where in the activation pipeline is this (strategy, universe) combo?* |
| **Health lifecycle** | `monitor/lifecycle.py` | `RAMP_UP → ACTIVE → WATCH → PROBATION → SUSPENDED` | *Is this LIVE combo performing within acceptable bounds right now?* |

A strategy is first tracked by the **promotion** lifecycle. Only once it reaches `LIVE` does the **health** lifecycle become relevant. Both machines can be consulted simultaneously for the dashboard.

Example: `momentum_breakout/sp500` could simultaneously be:
- Promotion state: `LIVE` (it's trading real capital)
- Health state: `WATCH` (its Sharpe dropped below 50% of backtest)

### State Descriptions

| State | Meaning | Who enters | Who exits |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `RESEARCH` | Discovered by research engine. Has a `research_best` row. Not yet validated in live market conditions. | Initial seed; auto-rollback from PAPER | auto_promote() → PAPER |
| `PAPER` | Trading on Alpaca paper account. Real market conditions, no capital at risk. 30-day minimum validation phase. **DEFERRED — not yet implemented.** | auto_promote() | Paper-promotion gate → LIVE; or divergence monitor → RESEARCH |
| `LIVE` | Trading real capital. Subject to health lifecycle monitoring. | Paper-promotion gate; legacy seed (pre-existing live strategies) | Manual decommission → RETIRED; soft rollback → PAPER |
| `RETIRED` | Decommissioned. No longer trading. Config set to `enabled: false`. | Manual decision | Revival → RESEARCH |

---

## Allowed System Transitions

Only `operator='system'` transitions are graph-enforced. `operator='manual'` bypasses the graph with a warning logged.

```python
ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS = {
    None:                  {RESEARCH, LIVE},           # initial seed only
    RESEARCH:              {PAPER, RETIRED},
    PAPER:                 {LIVE, RESEARCH, RETIRED},
    LIVE:                  {RETIRED, PAPER},            # PAPER = soft rollback
    RETIRED:               {RESEARCH},                  # revival path
}
```

## How the Three Sources Relate

```
research_best (SQLite)
  └─▶  strategy_lifecycle (SQLite) ◀──── config/active/*.json
                 │
                 ▼
         strategy_lifecycle_history (SQLite)
                 │
                 ▼
          (future) paper_trades table
                 │
                 ▼
           trades table (LIVE state only)
```

### Seeding rules (at lifecycle rollout — 2026-05-06)

1. **`config/active/<universe>.json` strategy with `enabled: true`** → seeded as `LIVE`.  
   These are pre-existing live strategies that were running before the lifecycle system existed.

2. **`research_best` row with `sharpe > 0`** (not already LIVE) → seeded as `RESEARCH`.  
   These strategies have been researched but have never traded real capital.

3. **`research_best` row with `sharpe ≤ 0`** → NOT seeded.  
   Negative-Sharpe strategies have no path to activation until re-researched.

**The migration is idempotent** — re-running does not overwrite existing rows.

## Persistence Layer

### `strategy_lifecycle` table

Primary key: `(strategy, universe)`. One row per active combo.

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `state` | Current promotion state (RESEARCH/PAPER/LIVE/RETIRED) |
| `entered_state_at` | ISO datetime of last state change |
| `prev_state` | State before this transition |
| `transition_reason` | Human-readable reason |
| `paper_start_date` | Set when entering PAPER state |
| `paper_end_date` | Set when leaving PAPER state |
| `auto_promotion_id` | Links to auto_promote audit trail |

### `strategy_lifecycle_history` table

Append-only audit log. One row per `transition()` call.

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `from_state` | NULL on initial seed |
| `to_state` | New state |
| `transitioned_at` | ISO datetime |
| `operator` | `'system'` for automated; username or `'manual'` for overrides |

---

## Python API

```python
from monitor.strategy_lifecycle import (
    PromotionState,
    get_state,
    transition,
    is_live,
    is_paper,
    list_state,
)

# Read current state
state = get_state("momentum_breakout", "sp500")  # → PromotionState.LIVE

# Transition (system — graph-enforced)
transition("new_strategy", "sp500", PromotionState.RESEARCH, reason="new discovery")
transition("new_strategy", "sp500", PromotionState.PAPER, reason="passed auto_promote gates")

# Manual override (bypasses graph — logged as warning)
transition("mr", "sp500", PromotionState.LIVE, reason="emergency", operator="alice")

# Convenience
is_live("momentum_breakout", "sp500")   # → True
is_paper("new_strategy", "sp500")       # → False

# List all strategies in a state
paper_combos = list_state(PromotionState.PAPER)
```

## Future Paper-Trading Workflow

> Paper executor is **DEFERRED**. See `tasks/strategy_lifecycle_remaining.md` for the full spec.

Once the paper executor is built, the promotion flow will be:

1. `auto_promote()` passes all gates (IS Sharpe ≥ 0.5, OOS Sharpe ≥ 0.3, OOS trades ≥ 30, CAGR ≥ 5%, DSR pass) → `transition(..., PAPER)`
2. Universe config `mode` set to `paper` — broker routes to Alpaca paper API
3. After 30 days: `scripts/auto_promote_paper_to_live.py` checks paper Sharpe vs research Sharpe (gap < 0.5) + absolute floor (≥ 0.3) → `transition(..., LIVE)`
4. Divergence monitor watches PAPER state: if gap > 0.5 for 5 consecutive days → `transition(..., RESEARCH)` (auto-rollback)
